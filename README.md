# Project 2 - *Wordle*

Submitted by: **Fiyinfoluwa Afolayan**

**Wordle** is an app that allows players to attempt to guess a hidden five-letter 
word within six attempts. After each guess, Wordle provides feedback by 
highlighting correct letters in green, letters that are in the word but in the 
wrong position in yellow, and letters not in the word in gray.

In addition to the above, the user may now change some settings (such as changing 
the number of letters per row and a few other listed in the 'Required Features' 
section' below) for the game that change the user's app experience.

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total
